# 🚀 How to Get Your C2C App URL (Live Link)

Since your application is currently on your computer (`file:///...`), other people cannot see it. To get a **Public URL** (like `https://c2c-logistics.netlify.app`) that you can share on WhatsApp, follow these simple steps:

### Option 1: The Easiest Way (Netlify Drop)
1.  Open [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) in your browser.
2.  Open your folder `c:\Users\mn244\Desktop\website` in File Explorer.
3.  **Drag and drop** the `website` folder into the Netlify page.
4.  Netlify will upload it and give you a **Live URL** instantly.
5.  You can then rename the site to something like `c2c-logistics.netlify.app`.

### Option 2: Using Vercel (If you have an account)
1.  Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2.  Run `vercel` in this folder terminal.
3.  Follow the prompts (Yes, Yes, Yes).
4.  It will give you a Production URL.

### Option 3: GitHub Pages
1.  Create a new repository on GitHub.
2.  Push this code to the repository.
3.  Go to **Settings > Pages** and select the `main` branch.
4.  Your URL will be `https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]`.
