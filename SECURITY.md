# C2C: Security, Rules & Legal Framework 🛡️

To ensure the safety of our student community and the longevity of **C2C Logistics**, the following rules are strictly enforced:

## 1. Safety & Verification
- **Student-Only Network**: All runners must provide a valid University ID and active enrollment proof during registration.
- **Background Checks**: Internal student society records are checked for any disciplinary history.
- **Women-Only Wing**: A dedicated segment where female runners deliver exclusively to female students, particularly for deliveries to Girls' Hostels.

## 2. Parcel Policy
- **Open-Check Policy**: Runners have the right and obligation to check the contents of any non-sealed cafeteria item.
- **Prohibited Items**: 
  - ❌ Drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes.
  - ❌ Weapons or dangerous chemicals.
  - ❌ Any illegal or university-banned materials.
- **Weight Limit**: Maximum 5kg per delivery to ensure runner safety.

## 3. Financial Security
- **Cashless Options**: Integration with JazzCash and Easypaisa to reduce the risk of carrying cash.
- **Commission Settlement**: Automated daily settlement for runners to prevent accumulation of debt.
- **Refunds**: Orders not delivered within 30 minutes are eligible for a 50% delivery fee refund.

## 4. Legal & University Relations
- **Project Status**: C2C is registered as a "Student Entrepreneurship Project" with the Student Affairs Office.
- **Terms of Service**: Users agree that C2C is a platform connecting students and is not responsible for cafeteria food quality issues (only delivery).
- **Incident Reporting**: A 24/7 "SOS" button in the app (coming soon) for runners to report any harassment or safety issues.
