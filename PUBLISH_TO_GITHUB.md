    *   Name it: `c2c-logistics`
    *   Check "Add a README file"
    *   Click **Create repository**.
3.  **Upload Files**:
    *   Click **Add file** > **Upload files**.
    *   Drag and drop ALL files from your `website` folder (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`, images) into the box.
    *   Click **Commit changes**.
4.  **Activate Pages**:
    *   Go to **Settings** (tab at the top right of the repo).
